# Twitter_API

Uses Twitter's v2 API, Tweepy, Pandas, and Regex to pull tweets and extract text, author information, mentions, retweets, links, and more.

The main python file contains code to extract data about followers and friends, but only works in a v1 environment.

Tested with tweets from the National Parks Service #FatBearWeek
